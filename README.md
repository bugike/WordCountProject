# WordCountProject
Implemented a java program to analyze word frequency of two articles by using AVL tree or Hash table for data storage and sort the data with heap sort, quick sort, or merge sort.

The	commandline	form	for	WordCount	will	be	as	follows:	
java	WordCount	[	-b	|	-a	|	-h	]	[	-frequency	|	-num_unique	]	<filename>	
•	-b				Use	an	Unbalanced	BST	to	implement	the	DataCounter	
•	-a				Use	an	AVL	Tree	
•	-h				Use	a	Hashtable	
•	-frequency			  Print	all	the	word/frequency	pairs,	ordered	by	frequency,	and	then	by	the	words	in	lexicographic	order	
•	-num_unique       Print	the	number	of	unique	words	in	the	document.	This	is	the	total	number	of	distinct	(different)	words	in	the	document.	Words	that	appear	more	than	once	are	only	counted	as	a	single	word	for	this	statistic.
